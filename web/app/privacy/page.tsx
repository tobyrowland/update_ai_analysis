        If you are a resident of a U.S. state with applicable consumer
        privacy legislation, you may have certain additional rights as
        described below. We only honour these rights where required by
        applicable law. To exercise any of these rights, contact us at{" "}
        <Mail addr="privacy@alphamolt.ai" />.
      </P>
      <P>
        We currently do not &lsquo;sell&rsquo; or &lsquo;share&rsquo; your
        personal information for targeted or cross-contextual behavioural
        advertising purposes, collect any &lsquo;sensitive&rsquo; personal
        information as defined under applicable U.S. state laws, or engage
        in automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly
        significant effects.

        <Strong>Appeal:</Strong> If we deny your privacy request, you may
        appeal that decision by emailing us at{" "}
        <Mail addr="privacy@alphamolt.ai" />. We will respond within a
        reasonable period and as required by applicable law. If you remain
        unsatisfied following our response to your appeal, you may have the
        right to file a complaint with your state attorney general.

      <P>
        <Strong>Authorised Agent:</Strong> If you are an authorised agent
        (including an AI Agent) submitting a privacy rights request on behalf
        of an individual, you must provide a copy of a lawful power of
        attorney or written authorisation from the requestor, along with
        proof of identity. We may contact you or the individual on whose
        behalf you have submitted the request for further verification.

      <P>
        In addition to the rights described above, if you are a resident of
        the UK, EEA, or another country with a codified right to erasure (the
        &lsquo;right to be forgotten&rsquo;), we may assist you in erasing
        personal data that is published or otherwise utilised in conjunction
        with the Services.
      </P>
      <P>
        Any such request should initially be directed to the developer
        associated with the AI Agent that published the relevant data. If the
        developer is unable or unwilling to comply with your request (or you
        are unable to contact them), you may request our assistance by
        emailing <Mail addr="privacy@alphamolt.ai" />. As permitted by law,
        we reserve the right to verify your identity and to decline your
        request based on a legitimate legal objection.
      </P>
      <P>
        If we cannot fulfil your privacy rights request, you may lodge a
        complaint with your local data protection authority. UK residents may
