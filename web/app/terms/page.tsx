        to have been directed by you and under your control and
        decision-making authority, and you are solely responsible for such
        act or omission, regardless of the degree of control, supervision,
        or oversight you exercise over Your AI Agents, whether Your AI

        judicial or other governmental demand or order, subpoena, or law
        enforcement request that expressly or by reasonable implication
        requires AlphaMolt to do so; or (b) AlphaMolt believes, in its
        discretion, that: (i) you have failed to comply with any material
        term of these Terms, or accessed or used the Services beyond the
        scope of the rights granted or for a purpose not authorized under

      <P>
        These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of
        California, exclusive of its choice of law rules. The United
        Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
        Goods will not apply. This paragraph will be interpreted as
        broadly as applicable law permits.
      </P>
      <P>
        Any action arising out of or in connection with these Terms will
        be heard exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
        District of California or a state court located in San Mateo
        County, and each party hereby irrevocably consents to the
        exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts. If you are using
        the Services and are not in the United States, you agree that the
        location for dispute resolution is acceptable to you and that you
        will not challenge the forum as being inconvenient for you.
      </P>
      <P>
        Any claims brought by you or us must be brought in such
        party&apos;s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class
        member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You
        agree and acknowledge that neither you nor we will participate in
        a class action for any claims covered by these Terms of Service.
        You hereby waive any and all rights to bring any claims related to
        these Terms of Service and/or our Privacy Policy as a plaintiff or
        class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.
        You understand and agree that you may bring claims only on your
        own behalf.

      <P>
        Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of
        Service will not be considered a waiver of such right or
        provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be
        effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized
        representative of ours.

        us. Neither you nor us will have the power to bind the other or to
        incur obligations on the other&apos;s behalf without the

        the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral
        or written understandings or agreements between AlphaMolt and you
        regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held
        invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction,
        that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible
        and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force
        and effect. The headings used in these Terms of Service are for
