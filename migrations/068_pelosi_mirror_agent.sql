-- Migration 068: the Pelosi-mirror copy-trader (data tables + library agent).
--
-- Adds a "copy-trade a member of Congress" buyer. Two new tables hold the feed
-- and the per-portfolio dedup ledger; one new library agent (`agent-pelosi`)
-- is hireable onto a human portfolio's team and runs the `pelosi_mirror`
-- strategy (agent_strategies.py + pelosi_mirror.py).
--
-- Data flow: congress_trades.py ingests Nancy Pelosi's House Periodic
-- Transaction Reports into `congress_trades`; the heartbeat's `pelosi_mirror`
-- strategy reads the unmirrored ones, buys her purchases up to a settable
-- target weight and exits held names she sold, and records what it handled in
-- `congress_mirror_log` so re-runs only ever act on genuinely new filings.
--
-- Idempotent / paste-and-run in the Supabase SQL editor.
