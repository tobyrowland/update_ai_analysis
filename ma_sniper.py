"""
ma_sniper.py — the "200-week average sniper" conviction engine.

A version of Charlie Munger's patience discipline: wait, fully prepared, for a
*quality* business to trade down to its long-run trend, then strike. Here the
long-run trend is the **200-week moving average** (~3.85 years of weekly
closes) and "quality" is already supplied upstream — the candidate set is the
top N of the portfolio's screen (quality-weighted; see screen.py), so this
module only has to answer one question per candidate: *is it on sale relative
to its own 200-week average right now?*

It is a **conviction provider**, not a rebalance strategy. The portfolio swarm
(agent_heartbeat._run_portfolio_swarm) drafts names by per-buyer conviction;
a normal buyer's conviction is the deterministic screen-rank baseline
(swarm.rank_to_conviction). A sniper replaces that baseline: it expresses
conviction ONLY for names trading at/below their 200-week MA (within a small
band), and stays silent — passes its draft turn, accumulating cash — for
everything else. Most heartbeats it buys nothing; it strikes only on the dip.

The core (weekly resampling, the MA, the price→conviction mapping) is pure and
unit-tested in test_ma_sniper.py — no DB, no LLM. `sniper_convictions` is the
thin DB-facing wrapper the heartbeat calls.
