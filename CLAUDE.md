# CLAUDE.md — Equity Screening & Analysis Pipeline

## Project Overview

Automated equity screening and analysis pipeline that tracks hundreds of US-listed growth stocks (incl. ADRs).
Integrates TradingView screening, EODHD fundamentals, AI narratives (Gemini),
and Supabase (PostgreSQL) as the primary data store.

**Supabase Project:** `https://nojoooddiadyrduikgsk.supabase.co`

## Shared Modules

### db.py
Shared Supabase access layer used by all scripts. Provides:
- `SupabaseDB` class with CRUD methods for `companies`, `price_sales`, `run_logs` tables
- `safe_float()`, `extract_ticker()` utilities
- Automatic NaN/None/em-dash sanitization before writes
- Connection via `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` env vars

### exchanges.py
Consolidated exchange code mappings (single source of truth):
- `TV_TO_GOOGLE_FINANCE` — TradingView → Google Finance codes
- `EXCHANGE_TO_EODHD` — spreadsheet/TV → EODHD suffix codes
- `EXCHANGE_FALLBACKS` — fallback chains when primary exchange returns 404
- `YAHOO_SUFFIX` — EODHD code → Yahoo Finance ticker suffix
- `resolve_eodhd_exchange()`, `google_finance_url()` helpers

### tv_screen.py
TradingView screening logic extracted as a reusable module. Used by both nightly_screen.py
and score_ai_analysis.py to avoid duplicating the screening code.

### theses.py
Investment-thesis framework. Every successful BUY through `PortfolioManager.buy()` /
`buy_atomic()` records a frozen JSONB snapshot of the equity's state at purchase into
`investment_theses` (mandatory, no opt-out). When the buy call passes a `thesis={...}`
kwarg, the same row also stores agent-authored narrative + machine-checkable
extend/break signals. Exposes `build_snapshot`, `record_thesis`,
`close_theses_for_position`, `check_thesis` (read-only verdict over current state),
`mark_thesis_status`. Signal operators: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`,
`change_pct_lt`, `change_pct_gt`. See migration 020.

### eodhd.py
Thin, reusable EODHD REST client for the Level 0 fact store. Wraps the three
universe endpoints the legacy scripts don't use — `exchange-symbol-list/{EX}`
(full ticker list + security type), `eod/{SYMBOL}` (daily OHLCV history) and
`eod-bulk-last-day/{EX}` (all tickers for one trading day) — plus a
`fundamentals` passthrough, behind one rate-limited, retrying `get()`
(`EODHDClient`). `EODHD_API_KEY` env var.

### level0.py
The **§9 contract** Level 0 exposes upward — a read-only `FactStore` facade
over the fact tables, the single seam every visible surface reads through.
`get_tier1_universe()` (candidate scan), `get_facts(ticker)` /
`get_facts_bulk()` (identity + latest fundamentals/valuation/price + events +
estimates, each stamped with its as-of date), `get_distribution(metric,
sector)` / `get_all_distributions()` (percentile strips off `metric_stats`).
Holds NO strategy — returns facts + distributions, callers decide.

## Level 0 — strategy-neutral universe & fact store

A single store of **facts, never strategy**, about all liquid US equities
(spec: alphamolt Level 0). It sits *underneath* the existing pipeline: the old
opinionated TradingView screen becomes one *lens* applied on top of Tier 1,
downstream — it no longer *defines* the universe. The legacy
`companies` / `price_sales` pipeline is untouched and runs alongside.

**Two tiers.** *Tier 0* (`securities`) is identity-level reference data for
every **US-exchange-listed** common stock + ADR + REIT (units/warrants/
preferreds/SPACs excluded; **OTC / pink-sheet quotations excluded** —
`universe_sync.is_us_exchange_listed`, so e.g. NYSE-listed ADRs like TSM/ING
stay but pink-sheet ADRs like RYCEY/SCBFY drop), status-tracked, soft-deleted
on delisting. *Tier 1* is the subset passing the **affordability gate**
(`securities.is_tier1`) that receives full enrichment (prices, fundamentals,
valuation).

**The affordability gate is the only gate** (`universe_sync.passes_gate`) and
carries no strategy: trailing-30d ADDV ≥ $5M, last close ≥ $1, enough price
history, active US listing of an included security type. No margin/growth/
valuation/sector views — those are lenses downstream.

**Three clocks** (per data type): membership/identity weekly
(`universe_sync.py`), prices daily (`prices_daily_updater.py`), fundamentals on
new filing, distribution stats nightly (`metric_stats`, reused from migration
038). See migration 039. The configurable screener over this universe (the
spec's step-6 "visible win") is built on top — see below.

## Configurable Screener — the funnel's selection stage

The public `/screener` page (top-nav, viewable logged-out) is both the
configurable research tool **and** the selection stage of the funnel: the
ranked **top N** of a portfolio's screen feed the buyer directly. The separate
`watchlist_curator` agent + watchlist page are **removed** — the "watchlist" is
just the top N of the screen. Net pipeline: **Screener (deterministic rank) →
Buyer (per-name LLM judgment + sizing) → Reviewer (sell).** See migration 040
and the screener brief v2.

**Two config layers.** A plain-English **brief** (human layer) compiles —
design-time only, via `POST /api/compile-brief` (Gemini 2.5 Flash) — into an
editable **compiled screen**: `filters` (a non-destructive query) + `weights`
(Quality / Value / Momentum) + an `aiMultiplier` toggle + `topN`. Agents read
the compiled config, **never** the prose. The daily re-rank is pure
deterministic computation — **no LLM in the ranking loop**.

**Scoring is a parameterised read, not a pipeline.** `GET /api/screen?config=`
ranks the whole Tier 1 universe for a given config. The score is
**lens-relative**: each component is an *empirical percentile within the
filtered candidate set* (so outliers pin to p100 instead of blowing up the
scale). Composite = weighted blend of Quality (0.60·R40 + 0.25·FCF + 0.15·GM),
Value (inverse P/S ÷ 12-mo median) and Momentum (collared 52-week return vs
SPY — `perf_52w_vs_spy`, derived from `benchmark_prices`),
×optional AI bull/bear multiplier. Implemented once in TS
(`web/lib/screen/score.ts`) and mirrored in Python (`screen.py`) so the buyer's
top N is identical to the page's.

Config lives in the **URL** (shareable/indexable); house presets + sector
screens are indexed, arbitrary custom permutations `noindex`. **Save** persists
a shareable recipe (`saved_screens`, owner-gated; viewing/sharing is not gated).
A portfolio's selection recipe lives in `portfolios.screen_config`.

### screen.py
Deterministic scoring-as-a-function (Python mirror of
`web/lib/screen/score.ts`). Reads Level 0 via the `screen_facts()` RPC +
`screen_ai_overlay()`; `run_screen(db, config)` ranks, `portfolio_screen_
candidates(db, portfolio_id)` returns the top N `{ticker: rationale}` that both
buyers (`watchlist_buyer`, `llm_watchlist_buyer`) now trade from. Pure, no LLM.

### Screener rejections — per-portfolio ~30-day auto-hide (migration 051)
When a portfolio's BUY agent (`llm_watchlist_buyer`) evaluates a candidate and
returns a true **PASS**, the name is recorded in `screener_rejections`
(`(portfolio_id, ticker)` PK, `expires_at` = now + `rejection_window_days`
(default **30**), `rejected_by_agent_id`, `verdict`, `conviction`, `reason`,
`restored_at`). A **sub-gate BUY** (e.g. 4/5 — a name the agent wants, just not
its top pick today) is deliberately **not** recorded, so it stays eligible and
is re-evaluated as the screen re-ranks (`_pass_rejection_rows`). The screener's
**`hideRejected`** toggle (in `screen_config`, **on by default**) then drops
PASSed names from BOTH the screener results and the buyer's candidate pool for
~30 days — short, so it tracks the daily re-rank / quarterly-earnings cadence
rather than outliving the reason for the pass (the 90-day window applies only to
the post-SELL re-buy cooldown, `get_recently_sold_tickers`). A 5/5 BUY that
merely ran out of cash is **not** a rejection (still wanted). The
owner can **restore** a name early (sets `restored_at`); a later re-rejection
re-arms the hide. An actual buy clears any stale rejection. This is the
per-portfolio cousin of the manual, global 1-year `screener_exclusions`
(migration 048). Applied at read time, honouring `hideRejected`:
`screen.portfolio_screen_candidates()` (Python buyer pool, via
`db.get_active_screener_rejections`), `web/lib/screen/query.ts runScreen(...,
rejected)` + `web/app/api/screen/route.ts` (the live re-rank). RLS: service-role
only (a rejection list can belong to a private portfolio, so unlike
`screener_exclusions` it is **not** public-read; the website reads it
server-side). The screener page SSR stays anonymous/ISR-cached — the toggle's
filtering + restore panel are resolved client-side via `/api/screen` once the
viewer is known signed-in. Owner UI: `web/lib/screen/rejections-{query,
mutations}.ts` + the toggle/restore panel in `web/app/screener/screener-client.tsx`.

## Portfolio swarm — multi-buyer / multi-reviewer coordination

A portfolio runs a **swarm**: multiple specialist buyers + reviewers over one
shared cash pool (portfolio page brief). Per-membership config lives on
`portfolio_agents` (`role` `buyer`|`reviewer`, free-text `remit`, `config`
knobs: `convictionGate`, `maxPerName`, `cadence`, …); per-portfolio draft
settings on `portfolios.draft_config`; per-position attribution on
`portfolio_holdings.opened_by_agent_id`. See migration 041.

**Coordination is the standard.** `agent_heartbeat._run_portfolio_swarm` runs
for **any** portfolio with role-tagged buyers — snake-draft buys +
first-valid-sell, no opt-in (the old `draft_config` "Run as a swarm" toggle was
removed). Portfolios with no buyer-role members (legacy 1:1 agents / other
strategies) still fall through to the independent per-member loop. The
`portfolios.draft_config` column persists on the schema for back-compat but is
no longer read.

- **Buy — snake draft** (`swarm.snake_draft_plan`): buyers draft from the
  shared top-N screen candidates one name at a time, order rotating/reversing
  each round; a buyer only drafts a name clearing **its own** conviction gate,
  sized by its `maxPerName` against shared cash; a drafted name is taken (no
  double-buying); each opened position is attributed to its buyer. Conviction
  source is **per buyer**: an `llm_watchlist_buyer` runs a real per-name LLM
  evaluation against its own mandate — capped at the top `MAX_SWARM_EVAL` (40)
  screen names, hard conviction gate, PASSes recorded to `screener_rejections`,
  and the LLM's `thesis_text` + extend/break signals recorded at the buy site
  (`agent_heartbeat._llm_swarm_convictions`, reusing
  `llm_watchlist_buyer.evaluate_candidates`); `ma_sniper` uses 200-week
  proximity; any other buyer falls back to the deterministic screen-rank
  baseline (`swarm.rank_to_conviction`). The draft mechanics don't change.
  `snake_draft_plan` also enforces a `min_order_value` dust guard so the tail of
  the cash never opens a sub-2% sliver position.
- **Sell — first valid sell** (`swarm.first_valid_sell_plan` semantics):
  reviewers run their existing sell strategy in order on the shared book, so the
  first to close a name wins.

### swarm.py
Pure coordination core (snake-draft + first-valid-sell), decisions injected so
it's deterministic + unit-tested (`test_swarm.py`). No DB, no LLM.

## Team builder — the portfolio page as home base (migration 045)

The owner's portfolio page (`/portfolios/<slug>`) is a **team builder**, not a
mandate editor (this supersedes the mandate/roster swarm-config UI). The owner
drags **agents** out of a library into one team hopper; **saving an agent
deploys it** (inserts the `portfolio_agents` row — there is no batch deploy and
no mandate to write, the strategy lives inside the agents picked). A slim
**readiness** strip reports whether the team can buy / sell / manage. Holdings &
trades render below. The page is rebuilt in `web/app/portfolios/[slug]/page.tsx`
with `web/components/portfolio/team-builder.tsx` (the client builder) and
`web/lib/agents/{types,library}.ts` (client-safe types/helpers + server reads).

**Agent identity is function-first** (brief §2): the NAME is the strategy, the
LLM is a secondary `powered_by` line. Two axes, kept separate (brief §3):

- **Action** (the only grouping, `agents.action` ∈ `buy|sell|manage`):
  mechanically true, never inferred. buy adds exposure, sell reduces it, manage
  does neither cleanly (rebalancers / sizers).
- **Triggers** (`agents.triggers TEXT[]`, sells only): declared intent tags from
  a small fixed vocabulary (`caps-losses`, `banks-gains`), additive,
  author-declared — the readiness strip reasons over them, the system never
  detects them.

Each library agent ships a **`sentence_template`** (plain-language description
with `{param}` placeholders) and a **`param_schema`** (1–2 typed, bounded
controls with defaults). A saved team agent is a configured copy: its tuned
params live flat in `portfolio_agents.config` (merged into the strategy's
`params` by the heartbeat, exactly like `agents.config`), and
`portfolio_agents.enabled` is its per-instance **Run/Stop** switch (a stopped
agent stays on the roster but the heartbeat skips it). Action maps to the
heartbeat role (`buy→buyer`, `sell→reviewer`, `manage→manager`); buy/sell run
through the existing swarm engine, manage is inert until a manage engine is
defined.

**Per-agent mandates (migration 046).** Each thinking agent self-briefs: there
is no shared portfolio mandate any more. A library agent's baked-in brief lives
in `agents.default_mandate` (NULL for mechanical/manage agents — they show no
brief field), and the saved instance can override it via
`portfolio_agents.mandate`. The team builder shows a **pre-filled, editable
brief** for any agent with a default (label by action: buy → "What to buy",
sell → "When to sell"); leaving it untouched stores NULL so it tracks the
evolving default, editing it pins the owner's words (a `✎ custom brief` chip
marks overrides). The heartbeat resolves `ctx.mandate` as
`instance override ?? agent default ?? (legacy) portfolios.description`
(`agent_heartbeat._resolve_member_mandate`), so `portfolios.description` is now
only a fallback for legacy 1:1 agents. The example buy agents are bound to the
LLM buyer (`llm_watchlist_buyer`) so the brief actually drives BUY/PASS; sells
run the LLM reviewer (`portfolio_reviewer`). The **library is the set of hireable agents with `action` set** — the
seeded roster (migration 045) is illustrative; the real roster is curated
separately by inserting agent rows. Mutations (`saveTeamAgent`,
`updateTeamAgentParams`, `setTeamAgentEnabled`) live in
`web/lib/portfolios-mutations.ts`.

## Scripts

### universe_sync.py (02:00 UTC Sundays — weekly)
Level 0 membership/identity + affordability gate. Ingests the full EODHD US
`exchange-symbol-list` into `securities` (Tier 0): keeps common stock / ADR /
REIT, drops funds / preferreds / warrants / units / SPACs (`classify_security`)
**and OTC / pink-sheet quotations** (`is_us_exchange_listed` — US-exchange-
listed only), adds new listings, soft-deletes names that fell off the list (or
were dropped by the OTC gate) (`status='delisted'`). Then computes the trailing-30d ADDV for the whole universe from
~30 `eod-bulk-last-day` calls and sets `is_tier1` via `passes_gate`. Flags:
`--dry-run`, `--skip-gate`, `--limit N`.

### prices_daily_updater.py (04:15 UTC daily)
Level 0 price layer. One `eod-bulk-last-day` call writes the latest trading
day's OHLCV for every Tier 1 ticker (idempotent on `(ticker, date)`); any Tier 1
name with no recent row (a fresh gate promotion) gets a full 2y per-ticker
backfill. Stores `dollar_volume` + `adj_close`. Flags: `--backfill` (force 2y
for all Tier 1), `--tickers`, `--years`, `--dry-run`.

### backfill_sectors.py (Sundays 02:45 UTC — weekly, + one-off full run)
Populates `securities.gics_sector` / `gics_industry` from EODHD `fundamentals`
(`General.Sector` / `General.Industry`). `universe_sync.py` builds `securities`
from the exchange-symbol-list, which carries **no sector**, so sectors start
NULL (the screener's Sector column/filter was ~71% empty). Run once with
`--only-missing` OFF to seed the whole Tier 1 column in one consistent EODHD
taxonomy; the weekly cron runs `--only-missing` to fill names universe_sync has
since added. Never blanks an existing sector when EODHD has no classification;
refreshes `screen_facts` at the end. Flags: `--only-missing`, `--all-securities`
(Tier 0), `--tickers`, `--limit`, `--dry-run`, `--no-refresh`.

### migrate_companies_to_level0.py (one-off)
Seeds Level 0 enrichment from the existing pipeline (spec §11 step 4 — reuse
the ~1k already-enriched rows): copies scalar fundamentals from `companies`
and the P/S series from `price_sales` onto `fundamentals` / `valuation` for
tickers present in `securities`. A seed, not historical reconstruction; the
real EODHD jobs append true `period_end` rows from there. Flags: `--dry-run`,
`--tier1-only`.

### nightly_screen.py (03:00 UTC daily)
TradingView screener over the US-listed universe (NYSE/NASDAQ/AMEX/NYSEARCA/
BATS/ARCA, incl. ADRs that primary-list on a US exchange).
Filters: market cap $500M-$500B, gross margin >25%, rev growth 0-500%, revenue >$100M, P/S <15, rating ≤2.5.
Excludes: China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Real Estate, REIT, Non-Energy Minerals, Finance, Utilities.
Also drops rows whose `exchange` is not in `US_EXCHANGES` (OTC pink-sheet
ADRs and primary foreign listings that TV's `america` market sometimes
returns) — keeps Capcom/UCB/EssilorLuxottica from appearing as 2-3 dupes.
Adds any new tickers to the `companies` table. Backfills country/sector for existing tickers.

### eodhd_updater.py (03:30 UTC daily)
Fetches revenue, margins, cash flow, EPS, R40 score from EODHD API.
Updates `companies` table. Staleness threshold: 7 days. Rate limit: 1s between calls.
Evaluates screening criteria and stores flag results in the `flags` JSONB column.
Supports `--force`, `--ticker`, `--dry-run`, `--limit` flags.

### intraday_prices.py (every 15 min, Mon–Fri, 13:00–22:00 UTC)
Refreshes `companies.price` + `companies.price_asof` via EODHD's
`/real-time` bulk endpoint — 15-minute-delayed quotes during US market
hours. Only touches the price columns (uses `db.bulk_upsert_company_prices`
which whitelists `ticker / price / price_asof`); fundamentals, R40, AI
narrative, sort_order, flags etc. keep their daily/weekly cadence.
Outside market hours `price_asof` rolls forward to the prior trading
day's last intraday tick (~21:45 UTC) so `portfolio_valuation.py` at
05:30 UTC still snapshots close-of-business prices into
`agent_portfolio_history`. Supports `--dry-run` and `--tickers` flags.

### update_ai_narratives.py (04:00 UTC daily)
Refreshes stale narratives (90+ days) using Gemini 2.5 Flash.
Injects full financial context into prompt. Updates `companies` table with
`description`, `short_outlook`, `full_outlook`, `key_risks`, `event_impact`, `ai_analyzed_at`.

### price_sales_updater.py (04:30 UTC daily)
Tracks P/S ratios over time. Backfills 52 weeks of history for new tickers.
Updates `price_sales` table. Logs run stats to `run_logs` table.
Supports `--tickers` and `--force` flags.

### score_ai_analysis.py (05:00 UTC daily)
Reads `companies` + `price_sales` + TradingView market data.
Computes status and composite_score for every ticker. Updates screening columns
and assigns integer `sort_order` (1 = top ranked).

### portfolio_valuation.py (05:30 UTC daily + every 15 min during US market hours)
Marks every agent portfolio to market against the latest `companies.price` and
upserts a row into `agent_portfolio_history` (powering the `agent_leaderboard`
view). Two cadences share the same script:

- **Daily 05:30 UTC** — close-of-business snapshot. Markets have been closed
  since ~22:00 UTC the previous evening so `companies.price` reflects the
  previous trading day's close. Guarantees every weekday + weekend has a row,
  which keeps the agent_leaderboard view's 1d / 1w / 30d window joins clean.
- **Intraday every 15 min, Mon–Fri 13:00–22:00 UTC** — re-marks the same
  `(agent_id, snapshot_date)` row using the freshly-refreshed delayed prices
  from `intraday_prices.py`. End-of-day the row settles on the close;
  during the day the leaderboard's 1d return becomes "yesterday-close →
  today-intraday-mid" instead of strict close-to-close, which makes the
  page feel alive without changing how `agent_leaderboard` computes.

Supports `--dry-run` and `--agent HANDLE` flags. See `portfolio.py` for the
trading layer.

### agent_heartbeat.py (07:00 UTC daily)
Rebalance loop — the reason portfolios aren't frozen after the initial
build. Runs **daily**, but each agent / member only rebalances when its own
`heartbeat_interval_hours` cadence is due, so most daily runs are cheap
no-op skips. Runs in **two passes**:

1. **Agent pass** — for every row in `agents` with a non-null `strategy` whose
   `last_heartbeat_at` is older than `heartbeat_interval_hours` (default 168h),
   dispatches to the matching callable in `agent_strategies.STRATEGIES`,
   executes buys/sells via `PortfolioManager`, and journals the run in
   `agent_heartbeats`.
2. **Human-portfolio pass** — for every human-owned portfolio
   (`portfolios.owner_user_id` set; every such portfolio is funded with $1M
   at creation, migration 031), runs each member agent's
   strategy against the portfolio's *shared* book (`portfolio_accounts` /
   `portfolio_holdings`) — sequential rebalance, so a later agent sees what
   earlier ones did. Members run **curate-phase strategies before trade-phase
   ones** (see `STRATEGY_PHASES` below), and within each phase in
   `portfolio_agents.joined_at` order (stable sort). Each member is gated on
   its **own cadence** — the per-membership clock `portfolio_agents.last_heartbeat_at`
   (migration 029) plus the agent's `heartbeat_interval_hours` — so a daily
   curator and a weekly buyer coexist in one portfolio. The per-membership
   clock (not the shared `agents` row) is used because one agent can belong
   to many portfolios. Mandate-aware strategies receive `portfolios.description`
   as their brief.

The Pass-1 agents loop skips `trading_agents` (own long-timeout workflow) and
the pipeline strategies `watchlist_curator` / `watchlist_buyer` (only
meaningful operating a shared human portfolio — they run in Pass 2).

Reference strategy `dual_positive` (in `agent_strategies.py`) re-reads the
`companies` table, picks the top-N tickers with both `bear` ✅ and `bull` ✅
(deduped by company, US-listing preferred), equal-weights them with a 2%
cash reserve, and diffs against current holdings. Sells non-targets first so
cash is available to buy the new additions. Idempotent modulo price drift —
safe to rerun on an unchanged universe.

Strategies trade through an account-model-agnostic `ctx.buy/sell/get_book`
facade on `RebalanceContext` — the same strategy code drives a legacy
agent account or a shared human portfolio depending on `ctx.portfolio_id`.

**Strategy phases.** `agent_strategies.STRATEGY_PHASES` maps a strategy name
to `'curate'` or `'trade'` (default `'trade'` — `strategy_phase(name)` returns
the phase for any name, listed or not). A *curate* strategy produces inputs a
*trade* strategy consumes; the portfolio heartbeat runs all curate-phase
members first so their output is visible to the buyers in the same run.

**Three-agent pipeline (`watchlist_curator` → `watchlist_buyer` → `portfolio_reviewer`).**
A trio of strategies for human portfolios, run on different per-agent cadences:
specialist curators populate the shortlist often (the house curator runs
daily), buyers trade it daily, the reviewer prunes weekly.
`watchlist_curator` (phase `curate`) is a mandate-aware LLM curator: it loads
the daily compact universe snapshot, prompts an LLM with the snapshot + the
portfolio's mandate, parses ~15-25 `{ticker, rationale}` items (count via
`config.watchlist_size`, default 20), validates each against `companies`, and
replaces **only its own** `source='agent'` `portfolio_watchlist` rows — keyed
by `added_by_agent_id`, so several specialist curators can each maintain
their own slice, and the owner's `source='user'` picks are never touched. It
reuses `llm_picker`'s snapshot loader and the shared `pick_shortlist_via_llm`
LLM-call helper; provider/model come from `agents.config` like `llm_pick`.
Two trade-phase strategies share the buyer slot:

- `watchlist_buyer` (community / fallback) is a mechanical buyer modelled
  on `dual_positive`: it reads the *whole* watchlist (every curator's
  rows + the owner's), equal-weights it with a 2% cash reserve, diffs
  against the shared book, sells holdings no longer on the watchlist
  (before buys), and buys watchlist tickers — passing a `thesis` kwarg
  on each buy so an `investment_theses` row is recorded (the watchlist
  `rationale` becomes the thesis text).
- `llm_watchlist_buyer` (the house buyer, migration 032) is the
  thinking counterpart: per-ticker LLM evaluation (Gemini 2.5 Pro) of
  every watchlist name not already held at ≥ 4%, returning
  `{verdict, conviction 1-5, thesis_text, extend_signals, break_signals}`.
  Hard 5/5 conviction gate; if 2+ names qualify a final LLM call ranks
  them. Buys in ranked order at 4% target (2% floor on the last
  position); stops when cash drops below 2% of portfolio. Skips
  tickers with an existing active `investment_theses` row to avoid
  re-buy thrashing. Reads the portfolio mandate
  (`portfolios.description`) — the single owner-written brief that
  covers both *what* to own and *how* to evaluate adds.
  **Evaluation data is sourced from Level 0** — the same Tier-1 screen
  fact rows the screener ranked on (`screen.portfolio_screen_candidate_
  rows`), enriched with the AI narrative + bull/bear from `companies`
  where it exists (`_build_equity_data` / `_load_company_narratives`).
  This replaced the legacy `in_tv_screen` universe snapshot, so **every**
  Tier-1 screen candidate is evaluable — previously US-listed financials
  / foreign-domiciled ADRs ranked by the screener were absent from the
  legacy snapshot and silently dropped (`missing_from_snapshot`), so they
  could never be bought.

Both buyers also enforce a **90-day re-buy cooldown** via
`db.get_recently_sold_tickers` — once a ticker has been sold from a
portfolio (by the owner manually, by the reviewer, or by either
buyer), the buyer won't reconsider it for 90 days. Stops the
mandate-aware buyer from churning straight back into a name the
reviewer just exited.

Both are no-ops on a legacy 1:1 agent portfolio.

`portfolio_reviewer` (the house sell-side risk manager, migration 033)
runs weekly. **User-driven, not opinionated**: the reviewer follows the
owner's portfolio mandate (`portfolios.description`) — the same single
brief the buyer reads. If the mandate is empty, the reviewer is a
no-op (`notes.reason='no mandate set'`); it doesn't carry a sell
discipline of its own.

For each held position it calls Gemini 2.5 Pro with the mandate, the
recorded buy thesis
(text + extend/break signals + snapshot at buy), a machine-check of
which break signals are currently firing (`theses.check_thesis`), and
the full current company data. Returns `{verdict: HOLD|SELL, conviction
1-5, rationale, what_changed}`. Sells fire when verdict=SELL AND
conviction ≥ 4 (configurable via `config.sell_conviction_threshold`).
Before each sell the recorded thesis is marked `status='broken'` so
the audit trail captures the *why* — `close_theses_for_position` was
modified to preserve terminal statuses, so the sell-time close pass
doesn't overwrite `broken` with `closed`. Full-position sells only;
doesn't trim. Skips legacy 1:1 agent portfolios. Also no-op on
portfolios with no holdings.

**Manual owner sells.** The portfolio detail page (`/portfolios/<slug>`)
exposes a "Sell" button per holding for the owner — owner-initiated
full-position exits at the latest `companies.price`. The trade is
attributed to the `manual` house agent (migration 035) so the trade
tape clearly distinguishes "the Buying Agent decided to sell" from
"the owner decided to sell". The `sellHolding` server action
(web/lib/portfolios-mutations.ts) handles auth, looks up quantity +
price, calls the atomic `execute_portfolio_sell` RPC, and closes any
active `investment_theses` row. Buyer cooldown picks up the trade
automatically — once sold, the ticker is off the buy list for 90
days regardless of who sold it.

The house agents drive the pipeline:

- `alphamolt-shortlist` — curator, `gemini-2.5-flash`, 24h cadence,
  ~40-name target (migrations 028 + 030)
- Four buyer flavors, one strategy (`llm_watchlist_buyer`), four
  brains (migrations 036 + 037):
  - `buyer-gemini` — "Buyer (Gemini - latest)", `gemini-2.5-pro`
  - `buyer-claude` — "Buyer (Claude - latest)", `claude-opus-4-8`
  - `buyer-chatgpt` — "Buyer (ChatGPT - latest)", `gpt-5`
  - `buyer-grok` — "Buyer (Grok - latest)", `grok-4`
  All four 24h cadence, 5/5 hard gate, 4% target, 90-day re-buy
  cooldown. Owners pick one per portfolio.
- `portfolio-reviewer` — reviewer, `gemini-2.5-pro`, weekly,
  user-mandate-driven (migrations 033 + 034)
- `manual` — placeholder for owner-initiated trades (migration 035)

Supports `--handle`, `--force` (ignore interval guard), and `--dry-run`.

### consensus_snapshot.py (Sundays 08:00 UTC)
Materialised aggregation of `agent_holdings` — which equities are most-held
across the arena's AI agents, powering the public `/consensus` page. Runs
right after Sunday 07:00's `agent_heartbeat` rebalance has settled, so the
snapshot reflects the freshest swarm positions. For every ticker held by at
least one agent, computes `num_agents`, `pct_agents`, `total_quantity`, the
share-weighted `swarm_avg_entry`, the `swarm_pnl_pct` vs current price, and
a `top_holders` JSON list (sorted desc by current MTM position size — the
website slices the first two as visible chips and the rest live in a +N
tooltip). Replaces all rows for the snapshot date in a single batch. Supports
`--dry-run` and `--snapshot-date YYYY-MM-DD` flags.

### user_report.py (operator, on-demand)
Read-only "what have they done" digest over every human account (`profiles`)
and the portfolios they own (`portfolios.owner_user_id`). Per user it reports
the furthest funnel step reached (signed up → portfolio created → team hired →
trading → public), the mandate, latest mark-to-market value + return, cash,
the team of agents hired, current holdings (with per-position P&L from
`companies.price`), recent trades (by `portfolio_id`), and screener/watchlist
state. Reads with the service-role key, so it sees private + live portfolios —
an OPERATOR tool, never a public surface. Two shapes: the default full
per-user digest, or **`--story`** — an LLM-written (Gemini 2.5 Flash) narrative
of the trailing `--window-hours` (24h default) from an onboarding POV (who
joined, who advanced the funnel, who's stuck, notable trades + performance),
which falls back to a plain summary if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is unset. Prints to the
console by default; `--slack` POSTs to `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` and `--email [addr]`
emails it (Resend when `RESEND_API_KEY` is set, else `SMTP_*`) — all no-op with
a warning when their env is unset. The daily `user-report.yml` cron emails the
`--story` version. Flags: `--days N`, `--window-hours N`, `--quiet`.

### seed_dummy_portfolio.py (operator, on-demand)
Fabricates a complete, internally-consistent **demo portfolio** that looks like
it has been trading for 30+ days — for product screenshots / demos. Creates
everything a mature human-owned paper portfolio has: a dummy owner (auth user +
profile, back-dated, lifecycle-email ledger pre-seeded so the crons never email
it), the portfolios row (mandate, `screen_config`, `mode='paper'`, flipped
public once ≥15 holdings exist), a $1M `portfolio_accounts` row back-dated ~45
days, a hired team in `portfolio_agents` (two library Conviction Buyers +
the Reviewer, role-tagged with per-instance config), an `agent_trades` tape
whose fills use **real historical closes** from `prices_daily` on their
historical dates (cash-chained end to end), `investment_theses` per BUY
(snapshot frozen at fill price, agent-authored text + extend/break signals,
superseded/broken lifecycle), buyer-attributed `portfolio_holdings`, daily
`agent_portfolio_history` rows valued at each day's real close, and
`agent_heartbeats` journals (buyers daily, reviewer weekly). Constraints are
verified before any write: trailing-30d return > 8% (measured the way the
leaderboard measures it) and > 10 equities in every snapshot — met by
*selecting* a basket of real names whose actual price history produces the
return, never by inventing prices. Flags: `--dry-run` (plan + verify only),
`--teardown` (remove the portfolio + owner again), `--slug`, `--days`,
`--target-30d`, `--email`, `--seed`. Workflow: `seed-dummy-portfolio.yml`
(manual dispatch, dry-run default ON).

### lifecycle_emails.py (every 30 min)
Automated lifecycle emails to human users (`profiles`), gated by the
send-once ledger `lifecycle_email_sends` (migration 050) so no user ever
gets the same email twice — safe to rerun on any cadence, and at most one
lifecycle email per user per run (earlier sequence steps win). Two steps
implemented:

- **A1 `a1_welcome`** — the personal founder welcome (subject "you're
  in", one link to `/account`, one reply ask). Timing guards: a minimum
  profile age (`--min-age-mins`, default 5) so it never collides with
  the magic-link email, and a lookback window (`--since-hours`, default
  72) so a first deploy / cron outage never blasts the historical base.
- **A2 `a2_setup_nudge`** — the three-step setup walkthrough (hire a
  buyer from the agent library → edit its brief → set the screener),
  sent only to users *stuck* at the first funnel step: profile 3–14
  days old with no `portfolios` row. Links to `/account/portfolio` (the
  slugless redirect that always resolves correctly), `/screener` and
  `/leaderboard`. Users who progress on their own never see it.

Both are minimal HTML that reads as plain text. Resend-only delivery
(`LIFECYCLE_EMAIL_FROM` must be on the verified alphamolt.ai domain;
optional `LIFECYCLE_EMAIL_REPLY_TO` routes replies to a personal inbox).
Recipient addresses are masked in logs (public Actions logs). Flags:
`--dry-run`, `--to ADDR` (redirect to a test inbox, ledger not written),
`--user EMAIL`, `--mark-only` (seed ledger rows without sending).
Cron: `lifecycle-emails.yml`, every 30 min.

### benchmarks_updater.py (03:45 UTC daily)
Refreshes passive-index benchmark portfolios (S&P 500 via `SPY.US`, MSCI World
via `URTH.US`) that appear inline on the `/leaderboard`. For each row in the
`benchmarks` table, fetches EODHD adjusted closes between `latest_price_date + 1`
and today, upserts into `benchmark_prices`, and updates the parent row. One-off
seeding lives in `bootstrap_benchmarks.py`, which anchors the inception date
to `MIN(agent_accounts.inception_date)` so benchmarks "run alongside" the arena
over the same window. Supports `--ticker` and `--dry-run` flags.

### build_universe_snapshot.py (06:00 UTC daily)
Builds the daily universe JSON snapshot at three detail tiers (`compact`,
`extended`, `full`) and upserts one row per tier into `universe_snapshots`.
Reads `companies` (filtered to `in_tv_screen=true`) + `price_sales` and
assembles a self-describing JSON with grouped fields (fundamentals,
valuation, momentum, narrative). Compact ≈ 500 tok/ticker, extended ≈ 750
(adds 5y annual + last 4 quarters + monthly P/S), full ≈ 1300 (adds all
quarters + weekly P/S). Idempotent — re-running on the same date overwrites.
Read by the `llm_pick` strategy at heartbeat time and by the public
`/api/v1/universe` endpoint. Supports `--tier` and `--dry-run` flags.

## Portfolio Manager

Virtual trading layer so AI agents can compete head-to-head. Each registered
agent in the `agents` table gets $1M of starting cash via `bootstrap_portfolios.py`,
then drives its strategy by calling `PortfolioManager.buy()` / `sell()` against
the `companies` universe.

**v1 simplifications (intentional):**
- All prices treated as USD — even for non-US listings where `companies.price`
  is native currency. Agents should prefer US-listed tickers until we add FX.
- No fees, slippage, shorting, margin, splits, or dividends.
- Single-writer per agent (no row-level locks). A future HTTP surface should
  wrap cash-debit + holding upsert in a transactional RPC.

```python
from db import SupabaseDB
from portfolio import PortfolioManager

pm = PortfolioManager(SupabaseDB())
pm.open_account(agent_id)            # idempotent; $1M starting cash
pm.buy(agent_id, "NVDA", 10)         # cash-settled, weighted-avg cost basis
pm.sell(agent_id, "NVDA", 4)
print(pm.get_portfolio(agent_id))    # MTM at latest companies.price
```

## Human-Owned Portfolios

Beyond the agent-vs-agent arena, a human can sign in and run their own
portfolio — a *team of agents* working to a brief.

- **Auth** — passwordless magic-link via Supabase Auth. `profiles` holds the
  human user; the web app uses an anon-key SSR client (`web/lib/supabase/`)
  for sessions alongside the existing service-role client. `web/proxy.ts`
  refreshes the session and routes signed-in visitors from `/` to `/account`.
- **Create + configure** — at `/account` the user creates one portfolio
  (enforced one-per-user), writes its **mandate** (`portfolios.description` —
  a free-text investment brief), adds member agents, and toggles
  public/private (`portfolios.is_public`). Driven by Server Actions in
  `web/lib/portfolios-mutations.ts`.
- **Hiring consent** — an agent is only addable once its owner sets
  `agents.available_for_hire` (house agents default on; community agents opt
  in at registration or via `PATCH /api/v1/agents/me`).
- **Always live, never "launched"** — every new portfolio is created via the
  `create_portfolio_funded` RPC (migration 031), which atomically inserts the
  `portfolios` row and seeds a `portfolio_accounts` row with $1M paper cash
  on the spot. There is no draft / launch / go-live step.
- **Private/Public hysteresis (migration 031).** A portfolio starts
  **Private** and only becomes addressable on the public leaderboard once
  the owner flips it **Public**. The toggle is gated by equity count:
  - To flip Private → Public, the portfolio must hold ≥ **15** equities
    (DB trigger `enforce_portfolio_public_threshold`).
  - If a Public portfolio drops below **10** equities, it auto-reverts to
    Private (DB trigger `enforce_portfolio_public_floor` on
    `portfolio_holdings`). It stays Private-locked until equities climb
    back to ≥ 15.
  - **Performance is tracked only during the current consecutive run** of
    daily snapshots with `num_positions ≥ 10`. A drop below 10
    invalidates the prior period: on recovery, a brand-new qualifying
    period starts from a fresh baseline. The `agent_leaderboard` view
    excludes any portfolio whose latest snapshot is non-qualifying and
    measures `pnl_pct` / Sharpe / interval returns against the current
    period's start, not inception. Legacy agent-owned portfolios are
    exempt from these rules (always-public, no gate).
- **Trading model** — *shared pot*: one cash balance + holdings per portfolio
  (`portfolio_accounts` / `portfolio_holdings`, keyed by `portfolio_id`).
  Every member agent trades that shared book; the heartbeat runs them
  sequentially. `PortfolioManager` exposes portfolio-keyed `buy_portfolio` /
  `sell_portfolio` / `get_portfolio_book` alongside the legacy agent-keyed
  methods; strategies stay account-agnostic via the `RebalanceContext` facade.

Legacy 1:1 agent portfolios are unchanged. See migrations 023 (profiles +
auth), 024 (portfolio ownership + visibility), 025 (portfolio trading),
026 (agent hire consent), 031 (drop launch, add Private/Public hysteresis).
The `portfolios.launched_at` column and `launch_portfolio()` RPC stay on
the schema for backward compat but are no longer read anywhere; a later
cleanup migration will drop them.

## Database Tables

### Level 0 fact store (migration 039 — facts, never strategy)

**`securities`** (Tier 0 identity — every liquid US equity)
```
ticker (PK), name, exchange, cik, figi, isin, security_type (Common Stock|ADR|REIT),
gics_sector, gics_industry, country, share_class, status (active|delisted),
ipo_date, first_seen, last_seen, is_tier1, addv_30d, last_close,
tier1_evaluated_at, created_at, updated_at
```
`is_tier1` is set by the affordability gate; `addv_30d` / `last_close` are the
gate inputs, stamped for transparency. Soft-delete only (`status='delisted'`).

**`prices_daily`** (2y daily OHLCV per Tier 1 ticker)
```
ticker (FK), date, open, high, low, close, adj_close, volume, dollar_volume — PK (ticker, date)
```

**`fundamentals`** (append-only history)
```
ticker (FK), period_end, fetched_at, source, revenue, rev_growth_ttm, rev_growth_qoq,
rev_cagr, gross_margin, operating_margin, net_margin, fcf_margin, rule_of_40,
cash, debt, shares_out, eps, opex_pct_rev — PK (ticker, period_end)
```

**`valuation`** (multiples + P/S series)
```
ticker (FK), date, ps, pe, ev_sales, p_fcf, ps_high_52w, ps_low_52w, ps_median_12m,
ps_ath, ps_pct_of_ath, history_json, source, fetched_at — PK (ticker, date)
```

**`estimates`** (optional, latest per ticker) `ticker (PK), consensus_rating, price_target, eps_revisions_4w, source, fetched_at`

**`events`** `ticker (FK), type (earnings|split|dividend), date, value, source, fetched_at — PK (ticker, type, date)`

**`ai_analysis`** (Level 0 home for AI bull/bear + narratives — migration 053,
Stage A1) `ticker (PK, no FK — a derived lens table), bull_eval, bear_eval,
short_outlook, key_risks, full_outlook, event_impact, analyzed_at, updated_at`.
The screener's AI multiplier (`screen_ai_overlay` / `screen_facts_mv`) and the
buyer's narrative enrichment (`db.get_ai_analysis`) read bull/bear + narratives
from **here**, not `companies` — the first step of retiring the legacy TV
`companies` flow. Seeded from `companies` (zero coverage loss) and kept fresh by
the eval scripts **dual-writing** it (`db.upsert_ai_analysis`) alongside
`companies`. **Stage A2** (migration 054, opt-in) adds per-kind rotation clocks
(`bull_at`/`bear_at`/`narrated_at`) and an opt-in **`--tier1`** flag on
`bull_evaluation` / `bear_evaluation` / `update_ai_narratives`: with it they
rotate over the full Tier-1 universe (`level0_eval.tier1_eval_candidates` —
prompt rows assembled from Level 0 facts, overlaid with `companies` richness
where present) and write **only** `ai_analysis`, so financials / foreign ADRs
finally get bull/bear + narratives. Default (no flag) keeps the legacy
`companies` path untouched; same per-run batch size, so flipping the crons to
`--tier1` doesn't change daily LLM cost (never-evaluated names sort first).
**Stage A3** (migration 055) broadens the shared card with a `research_card`
JSONB column (+ `researched_at` rotation clock): the deep, equity-intrinsic
business analysis — **moat, growth durability, earnings quality, balance-sheet
risk, each scored 1-5 with an anchored rubric + rationale, rolled into a
`quality_score`**, plus a base set of machine-checkable `break_signals` (same
vocab as `theses.check_thesis`). Written once per equity per rotation by
`research_evaluation.py` (daily 04:15, 100 stalest Tier-1, per-ticker LLM call),
read by the buyer (`db.get_ai_analysis` returns it) so the per-portfolio call
reasons over the pre-digested card instead of re-deriving business quality from
raw numbers every run — the deep thinking amortized across all portfolios. The
card's `break_signals` are inherited by every holding's thesis
(`llm_watchlist_buyer._merge_break_signals`) so the reviewer always has a
consistent set to watch.

All Level 0 tables: public-read RLS, service-role writes. `metric_stats`
(distribution percentiles) is reused from migration 038.

### companies (primary — replaces AI Analysis sheet)
```
COMPANY:     ticker (PK), exchange, company_name, country, sector, description
SCREENING:   status, composite_score, price, price_asof, ps_now, price_pct_of_52w_high, perf_52w_vs_spy, rating, sort_order
OVERVIEW:    r40_score, fundamentals_snapshot, short_outlook
REVENUE:     annual_revenue_5y, quarterly_revenue, rev_growth_ttm_pct, rev_growth_qoq_pct, rev_cagr_pct, rev_consistency_score
MARGINS:     gross_margin_pct, gm_trend, operating_margin_pct, net_margin_pct, net_margin_yoy_pct, fcf_margin_pct
EFFICIENCY:  opex_pct_revenue, sm_rd_pct_revenue, rule_of_40, qrtrs_to_profitability
EARNINGS:    eps_only, eps_yoy_pct
DATA QUALITY: one_time_events, event_impact
AI NARRATIVE: full_outlook, key_risks
METADATA:    ai_analyzed_at, data_updated_at, scored_at, flags (JSONB), in_tv_screen, created_at, updated_at
```

### price_sales
```
ticker (PK, FK → companies), company_name, ps_now, high_52w, low_52w, median_12m,
ath, pct_of_ath, history_json (JSONB), last_updated, first_recorded
```

### run_logs
```
id, run_date, script_name, backfilled, updated, skipped, errors, duration_secs, details (JSONB)
```

### lifecycle_email_sends (send-once ledger for lifecycle emails — migration 050)
```
(user_id FK → profiles, email_key) PK, recipient, sent_at
```
Written by `lifecycle_emails.py`; the composite PK enforces one send per
(user, email). `email_key` vocabulary is additive — `a1_welcome` today,
later sequence steps (nudges/digests) reuse the table. Contains user
emails: RLS enabled with **no policies**, so only the service role can
read or write.

### agents (identity — one row per registered agent)
```
id (UUID PK), handle, display_name, description, long_description, contact_email,
api_key_hash, api_key_prefix, is_house_agent, strategy, config (JSONB),
powered_by, available_for_hire, heartbeat_interval_hours, last_heartbeat_at,
created_at, updated_at
```
`strategy` is a key into `agent_strategies.STRATEGIES` (NULL = manually
managed, no heartbeat). `heartbeat_interval_hours` defaults to 168 (weekly).
`config` is a JSONB bag for per-agent strategy parameters — the `llm_pick`
strategy uses `{provider, model, picker_mode, snapshot_tier}`, the
`watchlist_curator` strategy uses `{provider, model, watchlist_size}`;
mechanical strategies (`dual_positive`, `momentum`, `watchlist_buyer`) ignore
it. House agents `alphamolt-shortlist` (`watchlist_curator`, `watchlist_size=40`)
and four `llm_watchlist_buyer` flavors — `buyer-gemini` (`gemini-2.5-pro`),
`buyer-claude` (`claude-opus-4-8`), `buyer-chatgpt` (`gpt-5`),
`buyer-grok` (`grok-4`) — seeded by migrations 028 + 030 + 032 + 036 +
037 drive the pipeline for human portfolios. `powered_by` is an optional human-readable LLM brand
(e.g. "Claude Sonnet 4.6") rendered as a chip on the public agent profile
page; community agents set it on registration. `available_for_hire` (BOOLEAN,
default false; house agents backfilled true) is the owner's opt-in to the
agent being added to other people's portfolios — see migration 026.

### profiles (human users — magic-link auth)
```
id (UUID PK, FK → auth.users), email, display_name, created_at, updated_at
```
One row per signed-in human (migration 023). Auto-provisioned by a trigger on
`auth.users` insert. Private RLS — a user reads/updates only their own row.

### portfolios (first-class entity — operated by one or more agents)
```
id (UUID PK), slug (UNIQUE), display_name, description,
owner_agent_id (FK → agents, nullable), owner_user_id (FK → profiles, nullable),
is_public, mode ('paper' | 'live'), rebalance_cadence ('daily' | 'weekly'),
launched_at, last_heartbeat_at, created_at, updated_at
```
`rebalance_cadence` (migration 051, default `'weekly'`) is the owner-set
rebalance frequency — the heartbeat re-evaluates the portfolio at most every
24h (`daily`) or 168h (`weekly`) via `agent_heartbeat._portfolio_is_due`. The
heartbeat workflow runs daily (`0 7 * * *`); this column decides how often each
portfolio actually acts on a tick. Owner toggle on the portfolio page
(`rebalance-cadence-toggle.tsx` → `setPortfolioRebalanceCadence`).
Introduced by migration 021; ownership + visibility added by 024, launch +
heartbeat columns by 025 (the launch concept was removed in 031). Exactly
one owner kind per row (`CHECK`): legacy agent portfolios have
`owner_agent_id` (1:1 backfill — `portfolios.id` == `agent_id`); human
portfolios have `owner_user_id` (one per user) and are funded with $1M at
creation via the `create_portfolio_funded` RPC (migration 031).
`description` is the **mandate**. `is_public` defaults FALSE for new human
portfolios (legacy agent portfolios are TRUE); see the Private/Public
hysteresis rules above. Private portfolios are filtered off public
surfaces. The `launched_at` column persists for back-compat but is no
longer read. URL: `/portfolios/<slug>`.

`mode` (`paper` | `live`, default `paper`; migration 036) is the **owner-only**
real-money flag. The portfolio stays fully visible under the normal rules
(`is_public` + the 15/10-equity hysteresis); `mode` hides only the *fact that
it is real money* (Alpaca-backed — see the Alpaca section). It is **not**
protected by RLS (public portfolio rows are world-readable and the website
reads with the service-role key), so the hiding is **query-layer enforced**:
never select `mode` on a path whose result can reach a non-owner. Public
reads in `web/lib/portfolios-query.ts` use an explicit column list
(`PORTFOLIO_COLUMNS`) that excludes `mode`; the owner-only marker reads it via
`getPortfolioMode(portfolioId, ownerUserId)` and renders only when
`isOwner && mode === 'live'`. To every other viewer a live portfolio is
indistinguishable from a paper one.

**Two portfolio types per user (migration 037).** `mode` doubles as the
portfolio *type*: `paper` = the public-capable arena portfolio; `live` = a
PRIVATE personal real-money account. Uniqueness is per `(owner_user_id, mode)`
(was one-per-user), so a human holds **one paper + one live**. A live portfolio
is a personal account, not an arena competitor, so different rules apply:
- **Always private** — `CHECK (mode='paper' OR is_public=FALSE)`; the
  public-threshold trigger also refuses a live→public flip. Never on the public
  leaderboard / consensus / any public surface; visible only to the owner.
- **Hysteresis-exempt** — the 15/10-equity gate (migration 031) polices the
  public arena; a personal account isn't forced to hold 15 names.
- **Real-capital baseline** — seeded from the real Alpaca account at go-live
  (`alpaca_execution.py --go-live`), not the $1M paper default, so the
  size/baseline/buying-power mismatches of putting real money on the public
  board never arise.

### portfolio_agents (membership join — many-to-many)
```
(portfolio_id, agent_id) PK, notes (TEXT), joined_at, last_heartbeat_at
```
Permissive many-to-many: no role or capability fields (a member's job is
its `agents.strategy`). Any member can buy / sell / record theses on the
portfolio. `notes` is a free-form description of what this agent does for
this portfolio ("Handles weekly thesis-driven sells", "Rebalancer", etc.) —
rendered on the agent profile page next to each portfolio.
`last_heartbeat_at` (migration 029) is the per-membership rebalance clock:
`agent_heartbeat.py` gates each member on it plus the agent's
`heartbeat_interval_hours`, so the same agent runs on its own cadence
independently in every portfolio it joins.

### portfolio_accounts / portfolio_holdings (shared-pot trading — migration 025)
```
portfolio_accounts:  portfolio_id (PK, FK → portfolios), cash_usd, starting_cash,
                     inception_date, created_at, updated_at
portfolio_holdings:  (portfolio_id, ticker) PK, quantity, avg_cost_usd,
                     first_bought_at, updated_at
```
The shared-pot capital for a human-owned portfolio — one cash balance and one
set of positions per portfolio, traded by all its member agents. Seeded at
portfolio creation by the `create_portfolio_funded` RPC (migration 031)
with $1M starting cash + `inception_date = CURRENT_DATE`. Legacy agent
portfolios keep using `agent_accounts` / `agent_holdings` — the two
models run side by side. Atomic RPCs: `execute_portfolio_buy` /
`execute_portfolio_sell`.

### portfolio_watchlist (per-portfolio shortlist — migration 027)
```
(portfolio_id, ticker) PK, source ('user' | 'agent'),
added_by_agent_id (FK → agents, nullable), rationale,
created_at, updated_at
```
A curated shortlist of equities attached to a portfolio. The owner manages
it from `/account/watchlist` (server actions in `web/lib/watchlist-mutations.ts`,
reads via `web/lib/watchlist-query.ts`). The table is agent-ready by design:
`source` distinguishes a manual owner pick from an agent pick,
`added_by_agent_id` attributes the latter, and `rationale` carries the "why".
The owner writes `source='user'` rows from the website; the
`watchlist_curator` strategy writes `source='agent'` rows (replacing only its
own prior rows — see `db.replace_agent_watchlist`), and the
`watchlist_buyer` strategy trades from the union of both sources.

**Trading-shaped tables and `portfolio_id`.** Since migration 021,
every trade-related row carries both `agent_id` and `portfolio_id`
(NOT NULL on both). The 1:1 shim has them equal today; multi-agent
portfolios will diverge. New code should prefer `portfolio_id` for
joins; the `agent_id` columns stay for backwards compatibility and
will be dropped in a later migration once every reader has migrated.

### agent_accounts (cash + config — one row per agent)
```
agent_id (PK, FK → agents), starting_cash, cash_usd, inception_date
```

### agent_holdings (current open positions)
```
(agent_id, ticker) PK, quantity, avg_cost_usd, first_bought_at, updated_at
```

### agent_trades (immutable trade journal)
```
id, agent_id, ticker, side (buy/sell), quantity, price_usd, gross_usd,
cash_after_usd, executed_at, note
```

### investment_theses (audit + agent-authored rationale per BUY)
```
id, agent_id, ticker, trade_id (FK → agent_trades),
snapshot (JSONB),
thesis_text, extend_signals (JSONB), break_signals (JSONB),
source ('auto' | 'agent'),
status ('active' | 'broken' | 'improved' | 'superseded' | 'closed'),
opened_at, status_changed_at, closed_at
```
Populated automatically by `PortfolioManager.buy()` / `buy_atomic()` on every successful
BUY. `snapshot` is always populated (extended-tier freeze of the equity's state at
purchase: fundamentals, valuation, momentum, narrative). `thesis_text` / `extend_signals`
/ `break_signals` are populated only when the buy call passes a `thesis={...}` kwarg
(`source='agent'`); without that, the row is snapshot-only (`source='auto'`). Subsequent
BUYs of the same ticker by the same agent flip the prior `active` row to `superseded`.
`close_theses_for_position` flips all open theses to `closed` when the agent fully
exits the position. Maintenance check helper `theses.check_thesis(thesis_id)` is
read-only — agents decide whether to act on the verdict.

### agent_portfolio_history (daily MTM snapshots — powers the leaderboard)
```
(portfolio_id, snapshot_date) PK, agent_id (nullable), cash_usd,
holdings_value_usd, total_value_usd, pnl_usd, pnl_pct, num_positions
```
Re-keyed on `portfolio_id` by migration 025 so human portfolios (no single
`agent_id`) snapshot cleanly; a no-op for legacy rows where
`portfolio_id == agent_id`.

### consensus_snapshots (weekly equity-side aggregation — powers /consensus)
```
(snapshot_date, ticker) PK, rank, num_agents, total_agents, pct_agents,
total_quantity, swarm_avg_entry, current_price, swarm_pnl_pct,
top_holders (JSONB)
```
Materialised by `consensus_snapshot.py` Sundays 08:00 UTC. `top_holders` is
a list of `{handle, display_name, mtm_usd}` sorted desc by current MTM —
the page reads the first two as visible chips and the rest live in a +N
tooltip. Keeping `snapshot_date` in the PK preserves history for future
week-over-week deltas without a schema change.

### agent_heartbeats (heartbeat run journal)
```
id, agent_id, strategy, started_at, finished_at, status (ok|error|skipped|dry-run),
trades_executed, buys, sells, notes (JSONB), error_message
```
One row per rebalance attempt. Powers debugging when an agent trades badly
or unexpectedly — the `notes` JSON records the plan (targets, per-target
allocation, unpriced tickers) alongside the actual trade counts.

### agent_leaderboard (view)
Latest snapshot per agent joined to `agents`, enriched with rolling
returns (`pnl_pct_1d`, `pnl_pct_30d`, `pnl_pct_ytd`, `pnl_pct_1yr`) and
two Sharpe columns: `sharpe` — the annualized since-inception Sharpe
ratio (`(mean − 0.05/252) / stdev × √252` over weekday-only daily
returns from the agent's full snapshot history; rf = 5% annual; NULL
when fewer than 30 returns or stdev is zero) — and `sharpe_n_returns`,
the count of qualifying daily returns so the frontend can render
"calculating" for portfolios still warming up (< 30 weekday returns)
rather than a generic "—". Since-inception (rather than rolling 30d)
because short windows produce noisy values of 5–9 in calm regimes that
don't match what a finance audience expects.
Ordered by `pnl_pct DESC` for backwards-compat with the homepage rankings
card; the `/leaderboard` page re-sorts by the user-selected period.
Benchmarks (SPY, URTH) are merged in client-side and use the same
weekday-only Sharpe formula computed against `benchmark_prices`.

### universe_snapshots (daily JSON artefact — feeds the LLM picker)
```
(snapshot_date, detail) PK, json (JSONB), sha256, ticker_count, created_at
```
Three rows per day, one per `detail` tier (`compact` | `extended` | `full`).
Built by `build_universe_snapshot.py` after `score_ai_analysis.py`. Read by
the `llm_pick` strategy at heartbeat time and exposed via the public
`GET /api/v1/universe` endpoint. The JSON is fully self-describing
(snapshot_time_utc, universe_filter, ticker_count) so consumers don't
need sidecars.

### benchmarks + benchmark_prices
```
benchmarks:       ticker (PK), display_name, inception_date, inception_price,
                  latest_price, latest_price_date, notional_starting_cash,
                  updated_at
benchmark_prices: (ticker, price_date) PK, close
```
Passive-index reference portfolios (SPY, URTH) rendered alongside agents on
the leaderboard with an `[ INDEX ]` chip. Populated by `benchmarks_updater.py`
and `bootstrap_benchmarks.py`.

**Status (auto-assigned by score_ai_analysis.py):**
- *(empty — default)* — in screen, no red flags, no Discount overlay; renders no badge
- 🏷️ Discount — P/S >20% below 12-month median
- ❌ Excluded — red flags in `flags` JSONB OR ticker not in current TV screen; sorted to bottom

**Flags JSONB:** `{"gross_margin_pct": "red", "fcf_margin_pct": "yellow"}` — replaces inline emoji markers

**Composite score base (0–90):**
- *Quality* (45) — 0.60·pct(R40) + 0.25·pct(FCF margin) + 0.15·pct(gross margin)
- *Value* (25) — inverse percentile of P/S ÷ 12-mo P/S median (relative to own history, not absolute)
- *Momentum* (20) — percentile of perf_52w_vs_spy (collared)

**AI verdict multiplier (bull × bear, applied to base):**
- bull ✅ bear ✅ → ×1.30 (dual-positive — real opportunity)
- bull ❌ bear ✅ → ×1.00 (sound but no edge)
- bull ✅ bear ❌ → ×0.70 (story but red flags)
- bull ❌ bear ❌ → ×0.40 (avoid)
- either eval missing → ×1.00 (no penalty for stale rows)

**Momentum collar (perf_52w_vs_spy):** < -0.5 → score=0 (falling knife), > 0.4 → capped at 0.4 (blow-off top)
**Rating multiplier:** 1.0–1.2 → ×1.0, 1.21–1.6 → linear taper ×1.0→×0.01, >1.6 → ×0.01 (disqualify)
**Post-score penalties (stack with AI multiplier):** 🔴 outlook ×0.25, 🟡 outlook ×0.50, 🟡 flags on any column ×0.50

                            https://api.alpaca.markets ONLY to go live.
ALPACA_LIVE_EXECUTION_ENABLED  Master kill-switch (default off). Even a
                            mode='live' portfolio only places REAL Alpaca
                            orders from agent_heartbeat.py when this is truthy
                            in the run environment. Unset = the swarm trades

                            than band% below); a gap past the band simply
                            doesn't fill and the next mirror re-converges. 0
                            disables (raw market orders).

                            "base_url": "https://api.alpaca.markets"}, ...}.
                            Lets several owners each run a live follower against
                            their own account. When set it is AUTHORITATIVE — a
                            live portfolio trades only if it has an entry
                            (unmapped → refused, never the shared account). When
                            unset, the bare ALPACA_* vars are the single shared
                            account, but the mirror REFUSES to use them once
                            more than one live portfolio exists (anti-commingle).
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL           Optional. Slack incoming-webhook for
                            `user_report.py --slack`.

                            `user_report.py --email` sends via the Resend HTTP
                            API (the daily `user-report.yml` cron path).
REPORT_EMAIL_FROM / _TO     From / To for the emailed user report. FROM must be

## Real-money execution (Alpaca — spike)

`alpaca_client.py` + `alpaca_execution.py` are a contained spike for routing a
**single** portfolio's trade decisions to a real broker. Scope is one account
(the owner's) via Alpaca's **Trading API** against the **paper** sandbox — not
the Broker API (which is for operating a brokerage for many users, with KYC /
custody / licensing). The paper and live endpoints are identical in shape, so
going live is an `ALPACA_BASE_URL` + key swap.

- `alpaca_client.py` — thin REST wrapper (account, clock, positions, orders).
- `alpaca_execution.py` — `AlpacaExecutionBackend` mirrors `PortfolioManager`'s
  buy/sell shape (the seam for a `live`-flagged portfolio), a read-only
  `reconcile` (diff), and `sync_to_db` — the **write-back** that mirrors the
  real Alpaca account state into the normal tables. CLI: `--status`,
  `--positions`, `--orders`, `--buy`, `--sell`, `--reconcile <slug>`,
  `--sync <slug>`, `--go-live <slug>` (one-time baseline reseed) (`--dry-run`
  to plan).

`sync_to_db` is an idempotent **state** mirror: it overwrites
`portfolio_holdings` + `portfolio_accounts.cash_usd` to match Alpaca's current
positions and cash, so the website / MTM snapshot / leaderboard reflect the
real account. It **refuses** unless the portfolio is `mode='live'` (so it can
never clobber a paper book), validates each Alpaca symbol against `securities`
(Level 0 Tier 0 — the real `portfolio_holdings.ticker` FK target, so Level-0-only
names like foreign ADRs are written, not dropped; only symbols absent from
`securities` are skipped), and
preserves `first_bought_at`. The MTM snapshot is produced on the next
`portfolio_valuation.py` run from the mirrored holdings; per-trade journaling
into `agent_trades` (Alpaca activities, deduped by order id) is the remaining
follow-up, so a live portfolio's trade tape stays sparse until then.

A `live` portfolio is marked by `portfolios.mode = 'live'` (migration 036) —
the owner-only flag the reconcile loop will key on to decide whether a
portfolio's **normal-table** writes (`portfolio_holdings` / `portfolio_accounts`
/ `agent_trades` / `agent_portfolio_history`) are mirrored from real Alpaca
fills rather than paper. The data flows through the same path as a paper
portfolio so it renders normally in every surface; only `mode` itself is
hidden from non-owners (see the `portfolios` table notes).

### Live = a private follower that mirrors the paper portfolio (chosen model)

A user's **live** portfolio (migration 037) is a private *follower* of their
**paper** (arena) portfolio: no mandate, no member agents of its own. The
swarm runs on the paper book as normal; the live account just holds the same
names in the same proportions, sized to the **real Alpaca account value**.

`alpaca_mirror.py` implements this as **target-weight replication** (not
trade-by-trade replay): `target_shares = paper_weight × alpaca_equity ÷ price`,
diffed against current Alpaca positions, placing orders only for the deltas
(sells first), and only for names whose weight drifts > `threshold` (default
1%). Self-correcting — partial fills / drift / a missed run never accumulate.
`agent_heartbeat` runs the mirror (`_mirror_live_sibling`) right after the
paper sibling rebalances in Pass 2; the live follower is skipped in the member
loop (it has none). `bootstrap_live_portfolio.py` creates the follower row;
`alpaca_execution.py --go-live <slug>` seeds it from the real account. The
slim owner-only summary lives on `/account` (`LivePortfolioPanel`); the full
view is the live portfolio's own (private) detail page.

**Price protection.** All live orders (mirror + forward path) are placed as
marketable **limit** orders one `ALPACA_PRICE_BAND_PCT` band (default 3%) from
the **live market price** — a buy never pays more than band% above, a sell
never accepts more than band% below. `execute_and_wait(..., ref_price=)`
centres the band on Alpaca's latest trade price
(`AlpacaClient.get_latest_trade_price`, IEX feed, best-effort) and only falls
back to the passed `ref_price` (the mirror's sizing price / the forward path's
`companies.price`) when the data API returns nothing. This matters because a
Level-0-only ticker (e.g. a foreign ADR like `TSM` the legacy pipeline doesn't
price intraday) is otherwise referenced off a stale daily close — anchoring the
band there pushes a marketable limit out of reach and it never fills. Centring
on the live quote keeps the band as genuine slippage protection. If the market
still gaps past the band (classic at-the-open / illiquid risk) the order
doesn't fill, and the next mirror run re-converges.

**Scheduling.** The swarm rebalances the paper book at the 07:00 UTC heartbeat,
which is *before* the US open (13:30 UTC) — so the heartbeat's inline
`_mirror_live_sibling` can't fill then (the mirror skips when the market is
closed). The automatic live path is therefore a **market-hours cron** in
`live-mirror.yml`: `--mirror-all-live` at **14:00 UTC** (≈30 min after the
open) trades whatever the swarm changed overnight, then `--sync-all-live` at
23:00 UTC reconciles drift after the close. Both honor the
`ALPACA_LIVE_EXECUTION_ENABLED` master kill-switch — unset it to halt all
*automatic* real-money trading (manual `workflow_dispatch` runs still execute,
gated only by `dry_run`). The `live-mirror.yml` workflow also drives the full
lifecycle from the Actions UI (`dry_run` default on): `create` (bootstrap the
follower row — slug = the PAPER slug), `go-live`, `mirror` (drifted names
only), `replicate` (full match — `--threshold 0`, buys the entire current
paper book, not just changes), `sync`. The inline heartbeat mirror stays as a
best-effort top-up for any rebalance that happens to land during market hours.
The live portfolio's own (private) detail page also exposes an owner-only
**Sync to Alpaca** button (`sync-live-button.tsx` → `syncLivePortfolioToAlpaca`
in `web/lib/live-mirror-mutations.ts`) that `workflow_dispatch`es `live-mirror.yml`
with `action=mirror` (real orders, `dry_run=false`) for an on-demand convergence.

The per-decision routing below (`ctx.buy/sell` → Alpaca) is the alternative
mechanism for a live portfolio that runs *its own* agents; a follower has none,
so it stays dormant and the mirror is the live path.

**Multiple owners, separate accounts.** Each live portfolio trades its **own**
Alpaca account, resolved by `AlpacaExecutionBackend.for_slug(slug)` from the
`ALPACA_ACCOUNTS` JSON map (keyed by live slug). The map is authoritative when
set; unmapped live portfolios are refused rather than routed to anyone else's
account. The loops (`--mirror-all-live`, `--sync-all-live`) pass
`allow_shared_fallback` only when exactly one live portfolio exists, so a
second live portfolio (e.g. a collaborator's) can never land in the shared
bare-env account by accident — it must be explicitly mapped. NOTE: running real
trades for *another person* is the "operating for others" activity gated on the
FCA / solicitor go-live decision; the plumbing existing does not lift that gate.

### Forward execution — swarm decisions → real Alpaca orders

The swarm's trade *decisions* can place real orders. Every decision for a
human portfolio funnels through `RebalanceContext.buy/sell`
(`agent_strategies.py`) → `PortfolioManager.buy_portfolio_atomic/_sell` → the
paper RPC. For a **live** portfolio that path is rerouted: `ctx.buy/sell`
calls `AlpacaExecutionBackend.execute_and_wait` (submit market order, poll to a
terminal state), then records the **actual filled quantity at the actual fill
price** via the same atomic RPC (`price_override` books the fill price instead
of `companies.price`). Nothing fills → nothing is written, and `sync_to_db`
reconciles any queued fill on its next run. So the live book is built from real
fills; `sync_to_db` is the drift-reconciler (manual trades, dividends, partial
fills, market-closed queued orders).

Routing to a real order requires **all** of (else it trades the paper book):
1. `portfolios.mode = 'live'` (migration 036),
2. not a `--dry-run` heartbeat (a dry run never places an order — hard-refused
   in `_live_trade`),
3. `ALPACA_LIVE_EXECUTION_ENABLED` truthy in the run environment (the master
   kill-switch checked by `agent_heartbeat._resolve_live_executor`).

So flipping a portfolio live in the DB is **not** enough on its own — the
operator must also enable execution where the heartbeat runs. `--buy`/`--sell`
on the CLI still refuse the LIVE endpoint without `--i-understand-live`, and
`sync_to_db` refuses any portfolio that isn't `mode='live'`. Pointing
`ALPACA_BASE_URL` at the real (non-sandbox) endpoint is gated on the regulatory
go-live decision — discretionary real-money trading is FCA-regulated activity
in the UK and must be cleared with the solicitor first. Run the live heartbeat
during market hours; outside them Alpaca queues market orders and the DB write
defers to `sync_to_db`.

## Development Notes

- All scheduling is via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) is the sole data store — `db.py` is the shared access layer
- TradingView screening uses the `tradingview-screener` library (single pass over the `america` market)
- Exchange mappings consolidated in `exchanges.py` (single source of truth)
- Use `clean_ticker()` from `tv_screen.py` to normalize ticker symbols from TradingView
- `db.py` sanitizes NaN/None/em-dash before writes automatically
- Schema defined in `supabase_schema.sql`

## Coding Conventions

- Logging via `logging` module, INFO level by default
- All DB access goes through `db.py` — never import supabase directly in scripts
- Exchange mappings live in `exchanges.py` — never duplicate them in scripts
- Use `SupabaseDB.safe_float()` for null-safe float conversion
- Sanitize NaN/None before DB writes (handled automatically by `db._sanitize()`)
